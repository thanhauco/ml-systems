# Green Computing

## PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)
Total Facility Power / IT Equipment Power.
Ideal = 1.0. Google Data Centers ~ 1.10.

## Carbon-Aware Scheduling
-   Wind blows at night. Sun shines at noon.
-   Shift batch predictions to:
    -   Different Time: 2 AM.
    -   Different Region: `us-central` (Wind) vs `us-east` (Coal).

## Lifecycle
-   Hardware manufacturing cost vs Operational cost.
-   Running a GPU for 3 years is better than upgrading every year (Embedded Carbon).
