# Human-Centered AI (HCAI)

## Design for Trust
-   **Reliability**: It works consistently.
-   **Competence**: It knows what it doesn't know.
-   **Immediacy**: It responds fast enough to feel like a tool.

## The Control-Automation Spectrum
1.  **Manual**: Human does everything.
2.  **Human-in-the-loop**: AI suggests, Human approves. (Radiology).
3.  **Human-on-the-loop**: AI acts, Human supervises and can intervene. (Self-driving).
4.  **Human-out-of-the-loop**: AI acts autonomously. (High frequency trading).

## UX Patterns for AI
-   **Confidence Scores**: Show "80% match".
-   **Explanations**: "Recommended because you watched X".
-   **Feedback Mechanisms**: "Was this helpful?".
