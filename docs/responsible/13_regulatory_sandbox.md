## Safe Testing Grounds
 Regulators (like GDPR or EU AI Act bodies) allow companies to test innovative AI in a controlled environment for a limited time.

## Benefits
1.  **For Innovators**: Legal certainty. Avoid fines while experimenting.

-   **Exit Strategy**: If harm occurs, shutdown immediately.

## Examples
