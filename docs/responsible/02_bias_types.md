# Types of Bias

## 1. Selection Bias
Training data doesn't represent the real world.
*Example*: Training a face recognition model mostly on lighter skin tones.

## 2. Historical Bias
Data accurately reflects the world, but the world is biased.
*Example*: Resume screening tool learns to downgrade women because historically fewer women were hired in tech.

## 3. Labeling Bias
The human labeler has prejudice.
*Example*: A doctor may be less likely to diagnose a certain condition in a specific demographic, leading to biased labels.

## 4. Aggregation Bias
One size does not fit all.
*Example*: A diabetes model that assumes the relationship between HbA1c and complications is the same for all ethnicities.
