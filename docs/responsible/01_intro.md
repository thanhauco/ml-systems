# Responsible AI

## The FAST Principle
1.  **Fairness**: Does the model treat different groups equally?
2.  **Accountability**: Who is responsible when the model fails?
3.  **Sustainability**: What is the environmental cost? (Green AI).
4.  **Transparency**: Can we explain *why* the model made a decision? (XAI).

## Why it matters
-   **Legal**: EU AI Act, GDPR, CCPA.
-   **Reputational**: "Racist algorithm" headlines destroy trust.
-   **Technical**: Biased models often generalize poorly.
