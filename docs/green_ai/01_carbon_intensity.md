# Carbon Intensity & Temporal Shifting

## The Grid Mix
Electricity carbon intensity (gCO2/kWh) varies based on the energy mix (solar/wind vs coal/gas).
- **Temporal Variance**: Sunny afternoons often have lower carbon intensity due to solar.
- **Spatial Variance**: Some regions are naturally greener (e.g., hydro-dominated nordic regions).

## Demand Shifting
- **Job Shifting**: Delaying non-urgent training jobs ("delay-tolerant") to time windows where carbon intensity is low.
- **Follow-the-Sun**: Moving workloads geographically to data centers where the sun is shining.

## API Integration
Services like ElectricityMap or WattTime provide real-time API signals for grid intensity.
