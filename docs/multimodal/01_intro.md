# Multimodal AI: The Convergence

## Beyond Text
Models that can see, hear, and speak.
-   **Vision**: CNNs -> ViTs.
-   **Audio**: Spectrograms -> Transformers.
-   **Video**: 3D Attention.

## Core challenges
1.  **Alignment**: How to map "A photo of a cat" to the pixel representation of a cat? (CLIP).
2.  **Generation**: How to sample from high-dimensional pixel space? (Diffusion).
3.  **Reasoning**: How to bridge the gap (e.g., "Explain why this meme is funny"). (GPT-4V).

## Modality Gap
The geometric distance between image embeddings and text embeddings.
